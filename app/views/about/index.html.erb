    <br>
  <p>Over 9 Million people experience loneliness in the UK. Research shows
    that loneliness and social isolation are harmful to our health;
    lacking social connections is a comparable risk factor for early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day,
    and is worse for us than well-known risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity.
    Loneliness increases the likelihood of mortality by 26%.</p>
